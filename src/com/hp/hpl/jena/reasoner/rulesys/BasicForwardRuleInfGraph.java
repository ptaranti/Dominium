/**
 * An inference graph interface that runs a set of forward chaining
 * rules to conclusion on each added triple and stores the entire
 * result set.
 * <p>
 * This implementation has a horribly inefficient rule chainer built in.
 * Once we have this working generalize this to an interface than
 * can call out to a rule engine and build a real rule engine (e.g. Rete style). </p>
