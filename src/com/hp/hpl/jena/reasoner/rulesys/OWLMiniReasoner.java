/**
 * Reasoner configuration for the OWL mini reasoner.
 * Key limitations over the normal OWL configuration are:
 * <UL>
 * <li>omits the someValuesFrom => bNode entailments</li>
 * <li>avoids any guard clauses which would break the find() contract</li>
 * <li>omits inheritance of range implications for XSD datatype ranges</li>
 * </UL>
