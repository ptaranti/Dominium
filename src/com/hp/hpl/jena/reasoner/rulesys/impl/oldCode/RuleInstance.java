/**
 * Part of the backward chaining rule interpreter. A RuleInstance
 * links an instance of a rule to the GoalResults object for which it is
 * generating results. It is a simple data structure which is shared amongst
 * a set of RuleSets to reduce the store turn over needed for RuleState creation.
 * <p>
 * Encapuslation warning: this object is used in the tight inner loop of the engine so we access its
 * field pointers directly rather than through accessor methods.
 * </p>
