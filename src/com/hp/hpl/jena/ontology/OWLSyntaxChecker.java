     * <p>Given an OWL ontology model owlModel,

     * level that the constructs
     * used in this model lie entirely within.  The three possible return values are 
     * {@link OWL#FULL_LANG} for OWL-full, 
     * {@link OWL#DL_LANG} for OWL-DL or
     * {@link OWL#LITE_LANG} for OWL-lite.
     * Note that these URI's are <strong>not</strong> officially sanctioned by the WebOnt 
     * working group.  For unknown reasons, the working group chose not to assign official
     * URI's to represent the different OWL language levels. There is a slim chance that this
     * may change in future, in which case these return values will change apropriately.
     * In addition, the given <code>problems</problems> list, if non-null, will be filled with the syntax
     * problems detected by the syntax checker.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The Jena OWL syntax checker will normally list as problems those constructs used in
     * this model that are in OWL Full but not permitted in OWL DL.  The exception to this
     * is if the {@linkplain OntModel#getProfile() language profile} for this model is  
     * {@linkplain OWLLiteProfile OWL Lite}, then the syntax checker will
     * test for constructs that lie in OWL-DL or OWL-Full and hence outside in OWL-Lite.
     * </p>

     * checker added to it.
     * @return A resource denoting the minimum OWL language level for owlModel
     * @exception OntologyException if owlModel is not an OWL model
