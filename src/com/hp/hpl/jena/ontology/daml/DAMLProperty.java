/**
 * <p>Encapsulates a property in a DAML ontology.  According to the specification,
 * a daml:Property is an alias for rdf:Property.  It also acts as the super-class for
 * more semantically meaningful property classes: datatype properties and object properties.
 * The DAML spec also allows any property to be unique (that is, it defines UniqueProperty
 * as a sub-class of Property), so uniqueness is modelled here as an attribute of a DAMLProperty.</p>
