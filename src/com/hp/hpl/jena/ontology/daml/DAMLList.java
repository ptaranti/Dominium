/**
 * <p>Java representation of a DAML List. A list is the specified interpretation of
 * rdf:parseType="daml:Collection" attributes, where a sequence of values is
 * interpreted as a nested sequence of head/tail list cells.  One consequence of this
 * is that the list is quite specifically ordered, whereas the daml:collection
 * is said to be an unordered collection.  Consquently, we must caution that future
 * versions of the DAML specificiation may create an unordered interpretation of
 * daml:collection, and client code should not rely on the positionality of elements
 * in the current list interpretation.</p>
