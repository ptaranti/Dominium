/**
 * A model lock.
 * Critical section support for multithreaed access to a model
 * within a single JVM. See also transactions support.
 *
 * Examples if application code:
 * <pre>
 * try {
 *   model.enterCriticalSection(ModelLock.READ) ;
 *   ...
 * } finally { model.leaveCriticalSection() ; }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Nested locks are provided for:
 * <pre>
 * try {
 *   model.enterCriticalSection(ModelLock.WRITE) ;
 *   libraryCall() ;
 *   ...
 * } finally { model.leaveCriticalSection() ; }
 *
 * void libraryCall()
 * {
 *   try {
 *     model.enterCriticalSection(ModelLock.READ) ;
 *     ... do library stuff ...
 *   } finally { model.leaveCriticalSection() ; }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Iterators should be used inside a critical section and not passed outside
 * the concurrency controlled block.
 * <pre>
 * try {
 *   model.enterCriticalSection(ModelLock.READ) ;
 *   StmtIterator sIter = ... ;
 *   for ( ; sIter.next; )
 *   {
 *       ...
 *   }
 *   sIter.close() ;
 * } finally { model.leaveCriticalSection() ; }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Note that if a library operation needs a write lock, the application must either have no
 * locks or a write lock when calling.  Lock promotion is not supported - it can lead to
 * deadlock.
 *
 * The hard work of locking is done by the
 * <a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/classes/EDU/oswego/cs/dl/util/concurrent/intro.html">util.concurrent</a>.
 * This is a convenience wrapper that provides nested locks, a special case of reentrant locks,
 * that does some checking.
