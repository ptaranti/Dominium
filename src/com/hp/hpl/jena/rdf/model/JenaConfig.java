/** A Class for configuring Jena's behaviour.
 *
 * <p>It is sometimes necessary to configure Jena's behaviour.  For example
 * when external functionality has changed, it may, for a time be desirable
 * to be able to configure Jena to continue the old behaviour so that existing
 * code which relied on the old behaviour does not break.<p>
 *
 * <p> Configuration options can sometimes be set using system properties.  The
 * following system properties are defined:</p>
 * <ul>
 *  <li><code>com.hp.hpl.jena.oldLiteralCompare</code>: This can be set
       to "true" before running Jena to turn on old literal compare behaviour.
       See <code>setOldLiteralCompare</code> below.</li>
 * </ul>
