/**
* Interface for database identifiers.
* Most RDF entities (resources, literals, statements) have an associated
* database index. These are cached using RDB-specific variants of the jena
* "impl" classes. This can avoid some redundant database lookup.
* <p>
* This variant just uses integers allocated by the database driver as indices.
* This would be sufficient for databases up to 4x10^9 statements.
