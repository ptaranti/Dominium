/**
* Interface for database identifiers.
* Most RDF entities (resources, literals, statements) have an associated
* database index. These are cached using RDB-specific variants of the jena
* "impl" classes. This can avoid some redundant database lookup.
* <p>
* In simple implementations the database identifier is simply an integer
* given a database row index allocated by some generator. In other implementations
* we use a "unique" hash of the resource or literal data itself. This interface
* encapsulates the different ID representations.
